1 - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new hidden directory is created with metadata that git will use to annotate
all the information it needs in order to track the changes to the files that
leaves in the directory.


2 - How is the Staging Area different from the Working Directory and the
	Repository?

Well, the staging area are the first step before a complete "commit", so
it is not a repository neither a working directory because the files in
the working directory can be altered by user and the staging area can't.






Stopped in: the beginning of 7/35 in Lesson 2



Observations:
- there is an "Staging area" where git put the files that are "added". It is
  not the commit yet, but an initial step which I still don't complete
  understand. The command "git reset file_name" is used to extract the file
  that has been incorrectly "added" to the Staging Area.

- git clone not only copies a directory, bat also the metadata of git 
associated with that data. To create a new repository use git init. But
don't forget to do a git commit, because git only created the repository. He
didn't committed the first version.

- "git reset" extracts from Staging Area as if the file was never there. I have
  been using: git rm -f --cached filename

- Simple summary:
	git add (put the file in the staging area)
	git commit (now the file is in the repository; editor opens to write
		comment)
	git status
	git log
