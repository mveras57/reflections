Beginning Lesson 3

In this lesson I will have to make several changes to a github
repository. So I had to verify that credential-osxkeychain was 
installed alongside git. This was ok.
Then I had to run the command:

	"git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain"

This will allow that my password in git be sent without asking
every time I make any change to a remote repository. It will ask only
when I clone a repository that requires password.




October 1st, 2016

- Continuing creating a project in GitHub; using commands:
	git remote (to see if there is a remote repository)
	git remote add origin URL (to link reflections with GitHub, using HTTPS)


September 28th, 2018
- Coming back to Udacity course on Git and GitHub; 

- Beginning Lesson 4 - Item 1

- I had connected my local repository to GitHub and I didn't remember. Since I returned to the beginning of Lesson 4, I did a new Push, with the command:
	
	git push origin master

where origin is the name of the remote repository in GitHub.

- There is a similar command (git log) in GitHub, accessible by the button Commits, but shows the commits in GitHub instead of the local commits;

- I have to create a new file directly in GitHub in order to see what will happen in my local repository; creating an garbage_file.txt;



Stopped in: 3/34 - Creating a GitHub account.



Reflections:

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	
	Remote repository is better when there is a cooperative work on something by several people.




News commands:

	git push origin master		- send all the commits from branch master to the 								remote in GitHub repository pointed to by origin.
