Beginning Lesson 3

In this lesson I will have to make several changes to a github
repository. So I had to verify that credential-osxkeychain was 
installed alongside git. This was ok.
Then I had to run the command:

	"git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain"

This will allow that my password in git be sent whitout asking
everytime I make any change to a remote repository. It will ask only
when I clone a repository that requires password.
